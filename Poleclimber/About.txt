<br><br><center>Connecting you to the world</center><br>
<p>We run the UK's digital network. We're the people who connect homes, mobile phone masts, schools, shops, banks, hospitals, libraries, broadcasters, governments and businesses – large and small – to the world.It's our mission to build the best possible network with the highest quality of service, and make sure that everyone in the UK can be connected.</p><br><br>
<center>Our History</center><br>
<p>We were created with a simple mission: to maintain and develop the phone and broadband network – the pipes and cables that connect the nation – and to sell products and services to communications providers.</p><br><br>
<p>Why Openreach?<br>
We were created as a result of Ofcom’s strategic review in 2005. Before that, BT owned and managed the phone and broadband network. But Ofcom decided a new organisation was needed to make sure all communications providers could access this network fairly.</p>
